# Arch platform #

Seeedstudio Arch is a mbed enabled platform based on NXP's LPC11U24 microcontroller. This platforms comes with header pins whose footprint are compatible with Arduino shields. The two on-board Grove connectors can be interfaced with numerous Grove based sensors, actuators and display modules.

Arch platform can be easily programmed over USB using the LPC11U24's inbuilt ISP driver. Unlike mbed LPC11U24, Arch platform does not come with mbed interface chip. Hence, an additional Arch board has to be used to debug the target using CMSIS-DAP.
